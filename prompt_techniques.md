##### THE C.R.E.A.T.E FRAMEWORK
If you want to write an effective prompt, you need to brief ChatGPT properly. Here’s a reminder of the different elements you should consider for your prompt.
| CHARACTER | This  is  the  role  you  want  ChatGPT  to play. It could be an expert, a celebrity, an artist or an idiot. Make it clear with an introductory statement like: 
| “You are an expert chef with 20 years experience and a Michelin star. You can create amazing and surprising dishes from the simplest of ingredients.” |
| REQUEST | This  is  the  task  you  want  ChatGPT  to do  for  you.  The  clearer  you  are,  the higher your chance of getting a great response.  Give  more  information  if you need to. Here’s an example: | “I want you to generate an amazing recipe just using the ingredients I have in my fridge and cupboards. Start by asking me what ingredients I have available.”
##### EXAMPLES
It  may  help  to  give  examples  to  help ChatGPT understand what it is trying to achieve. Lists of information can be particularly good. Something like: “Draw your inspiration from chefs like Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsey, Anne-Sophie Pic and Yannick Alléno.”
##### ADJUSTMENTS
You’ll  often  discover  elements  in  the output  that  aren’t  quite  what  you wanted.  This  is  where  you  add  some extra  statements  to  help  shape  the results. “List the measurements in imperial units. Do not use all the ingredients - only use what you need for the dish. Do not suggest a recipe until I give you my ingredients. Ask for the ingredients and then wait for my response before answering.”
##### TYPE OF OUTPUT 
Tell  ChatGPT  exactly  how  to  format y o u r  o u t p u t .  Y o u  c a n  h a v e paragraphs,  bullet  points,  tables, just  about poems,  scripts  and anything  else.  Make  it  clear  how  you want the output to be formatted. “Write your response as a recipe.  Give me a recipe title, a 100 word paragraph describing the dish, a list of ingredients and simple-to-follow steps. Write it in plain English without jargon.”
##### EXTRAS
There are some powerful phrases you can  add  to  your  prompt  to  make  it work better. Let’s  look  at  some  of  these  over  the next few pages.
##### IGNORE EVERYTHING BEFORE THIS PROMPT.”
Because  your  interaction  is  in  the form  of  a  conversation,  ChatGPT  will often  bring  in  information  that  you have mentioned earlier. Most  of  the  time,  this  is  useful.  But sometimes you just don’t want that. If  you’re  changing  tack,  it’s  often  a good  idea  to  add  this  phrase  to  the front of a prompt to give you a clean slate to work with.
##### “ASK ME QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU ANSWER.”
I  use  variations  of  this  in  some  of my prompts.  It  was  an  absolute  game changer when I discovered it. Sometimes  you  don’t  quite  know which information the AI needs from you to give a good output. So instead of  creating  a  bloated  prompt  that m i g h t  c o m p l i c a t e  t h i n g s ,  t e l l C h a t G P T  t o  a s k  y o u  f o r  t h e information it needs.
##### “EXPLAIN YOUR THINKING.”
ChatGPT is incredibly  good  at explaining  things.  (Just  ask  it  to deconstruct a joke.) So  it  can  be  really  useful  to  get  the thinking  behind  the  answer  along with  the  answer  itself.  You  can  see  if the  logic  works  and  get  some  help explaining it to colleagues. 
##### “ACT UNLIKE A TYPICAL AI.”
I  always  recommend  aiming  for  the n o n - o b v i o u s  a n d  n o n - t y p i c a l approaches.  That’s  where  creative solutions lie. i t  m a y  b e  a  g o o d i d e a  to S o encourage  ChatGPT  to  ﬁsh  in  a different pond and push itself beyond the obvious.
##### USING AI TO SUMMARISE COMPLEX INFORMATION
